If we had to summarize it in only three points, these would be the following: counter decoding, two different approaches ‚ÄìText-to-Gloss-to-Pose (T2G2P) and Text-to-Pose (T2P)‚Äì, and data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counter decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges of SLP is that the output has to maintain certain continuity. The predicted pose in a video frame has to flow naturally from the previous one, and analogously for the frames that follow. This is achieved in the following manner: the model not only predicts the sign pose, but also a \"counter\". This counter is nothing else but real number in the interval [0, 1]. This value increases monotonically from 0 to 1.0, marking thus the begining and end of sequence, respectively.\n",

    "**üí° Answer:** Begining of Sentence (BOS) and End of Sentence (EOS) tokens work well with sentences, but when producing video as we mentioned before we need something more than just marking the begging and end of it. Therefore, the counter serves both as an BOS and EOS and captures information about the flow of the video.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Just Counter**: in this case only the counter values are provided as target input to the model, omitting the 3D skeleton joint coordinates. Again, this has shown to improve results.\n",

We could guess that `neg-` simply means that the word is negated, e.g., `neg-GENUG`‚â° `NICHT GENUG`, but what about the `negalp-` prefix? And also, what do words such as `J+L+I` and `K+R+E+T+A` mean?

    "**üí° Answer:** Well, this is just a way of indicating that this token is \"non-initial\", i.e., originally it belonged to a longer word. This way of tokenizing words comes from the [WordPiece](https://paperswithcode.com/method/wordpiece) algorithm, which is used by the BERT tokenizer.\n",
