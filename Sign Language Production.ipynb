If we had to summarize it in only three points, these would be the following: counter decoding, two different approaches –Text-to-Gloss-to-Pose (T2G2P) and Text-to-Pose (T2P)–, and data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counter decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges of SLP is that the output has to maintain certain continuity. The predicted pose in a video frame has to flow naturally from the previous one, and analogously for the frames that follow. This is achieved in the following manner: the model not only predicts the sign pose, but also a \"counter\". This counter is nothing else but real number in the interval [0, 1]. This value increases monotonically from 0 to 1.0, marking thus the begining and end of sequence, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "**💡 Answer:** Begining of Sentence (BOS) and End of Sentence (EOS) tokens work well with sentences, but when producing video as we mentioned before we need something more than just marking the begging and end of it. Therefore, the counter serves both as an BOS and EOS and captures information about the flow of the video.\n",

    "\n",
    "In both cases, the models follow the architecture introduced in \"Transfomers is All You Need\" <a href=\"#ref_11\">[10]</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first approach –T2G2P– glosses are produced from the input tokens in a first step. Then, this glosses serve as input for another transformer, which then translates the glosses into sign poses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second –T2P– is an end-to-end approach, in which the text is directly translated into sign poses.\n",

    "Finally, the paper explores some data augmentation techniques to determine whether they improve the base model. These augmentations where only carried out with the T2G2P architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future Prediction**: this type of augmentation forces the model to predict the next 10 frames from the current time step, instead of just the next frame. In this way, the model cannot just copy the previous time step, which effectively improves performance over the base architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Just Counter**: in this case only the counter values are provided as target input to the model, omitting the 3D skeleton joint coordinates. Again, this has shown to improve results.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Words such as `AUSWAEHLEN`, `DUENN` and `HEISS` give us a hint that **normalization** is used. A popular algorithm for German normalization is the [German2 snowball algorithm](https://snowballstem.org/algorithms/german2/stemmer.html) which defines the following mappings:\n",
    "  - 'ß' is replaced by 'ss'.\n",
    "  - 'ä', 'ö', 'ü' are replaced by 'a', 'o', 'u', respectively.\n",
    "  - 'ae' and 'oe' are replaced by 'a', and 'o', respectively.\n",
    "  - 'ue' is replaced by 'u', when not following a vowel or q.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the words in the vocabulary include the prefixes `neg-` and `negalp-`. We could guess that `neg-` simply means that the word is negated, e.g., `neg-GENUG`≡ `NICHT GENUG`, but what about the `negalp-` prefix? And also, what do words such as `J+L+I` and `K+R+E+T+A` mean? A look to the paper of the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset [[10]](#ref_10) (the first version of the dataset used to train the model) gives us the answer:\n",
